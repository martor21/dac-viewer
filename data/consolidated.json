However, where a Financial Institution (other than a trust) does not have a residence for tax purposes (e.g., because it is treated as fiscally transparent, or it is located in a jurisdiction that does not have an income tax), it is considered to be subject to the jurisdiction of a Member State and it is, thus, a Member State Financial Institution if:</p>\n         <div class=\"grid-container grid-list\">\n            <div class=\"list grid-list-column-1\">\n               <span>(a)&nbsp;</span>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"grid-list-column-2\">\n               <p class=\"norm\">it is incorporated under the laws of the Member State;</p>\n            </div>\n         </div>\n         <div class=\"grid-container grid-list\">\n            <div class=\"list grid-list-column-1\">\n               <span>(b)&nbsp;</span>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"grid-list-column-2\">\n               <p class=\"norm\">it has its place of management (including effective management) in the Member State; or</p>\n            </div>\n         </div>\n         <div class=\"grid-container grid-list\">\n            <div class=\"list grid-list-column-1\">\n               <span>(c)&nbsp;</span>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"grid-list-column-2\">\n               <p class=\"norm\">it is subject to financial supervision in the Member State.</p>\n            </div>\n         </div>\n         <p class=\"norm\">Where a Financial Institution (other than a trust) is resident in two or more Member States, such Financial Institution will be subject to the reporting and due diligence obligations of the Member State in which it maintains the Financial Account(s).</p>\n         <p class=\"title-gr-seq-level-1\" id=\"id-0a0b09cb-7cfc-4a20-a7f6-be1642a63c65\">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=\"boldface\">Account maintained</span>\n         </p>\n         <p class=\"norm\">In general, an account would be considered to be maintained by a Financial Institution as follows:</p>\n         <div class=\"grid-container grid-list\">\n            <div class=\"list grid-list-column-1\">\n               <span>(a)&nbsp;</span>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"grid-list-column-2\">\n               <p class=\"norm\">in the case of a Custodial Account, by the Financial Institution that holds custody over the assets in the account (including a Financial Institution that holds assets in street name for an Account Holder in such institution);</p>\n            </div>\n         </div>\n         <div class=\"grid-container grid-list\">\n            <div class=\"list grid-list-column-1\">\n               <span>(b)&nbsp;</span>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"grid-list-column-2\">\n               <p class=\"norm\">in the case of a Depository Account, by the Financial Institution that is obligated to make payments with respect to the account (excluding an agent of a Financial Institution regardless of whether such agent is a Financial Institution);</p>\n            </div>\n         </div>\n         <div class=\"grid-container grid-list\">\n            <div class=\"list grid-list-column-1\">\n               <span>(c)&nbsp;</span>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"grid-list-column-2\">\n               <p class=\"norm\">in the case of any equity or debt interest in a Financial Institution that constitutes a Financial Account, by such Financial Institution;</p>\n            </div>\n         </div>\n         <div class=\"grid-container grid-list\">\n            <div class=\"list grid-list-column-1\">\n               <span>(d)&nbsp;</span>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"grid-list-column-2\">\n               <p class=\"norm\">in the case of a Cash Value Insurance Contract or an Annuity Contract, by the Financial Institution that is obligated to make payments with respect to the contract.</p>\n            </div>\n         </div>\n         <p class=\"title-gr-seq-level-1\" id=\"id-62a0823a-64d9-4c79-b5e3-042cdc561dea\">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=\"boldface\">Trusts that are Passive NFEs</span>\n         </p>\n         <p class=\"norm\">An Entity such as a partnership, limited liability partnership or similar legal arrangement that has no residence for tax purposes, according to subparagraph D(3) of Section VIII of Annex I, shall be treated as resident in the jurisdiction in which its place of effective management is situated.

For this purpose, independent contractors participating in the ordinary operating activities of the Constituent Entity may be reported as employees.
